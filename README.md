# pig
A java implementation of a "pig" game
When a player takes a turn, they will select the number of dice to
roll. These dice will be rolled simultaneously. If at least one of the dice
rolls a “1” then the player receives zero points for the round and it
becomes the next players turn. If all of the dice roll a “1” then the
player scores zero points for the round and their banked points is reset
to zero. If a player does not roll a “1” then all of
the dice are added to the player’s banked total and play proceeds to the
next player.
